- adjust command line: difficulty level, cheats, 50 FPS...
- long horse: missing easter egg. Ship appeared at some point as it was ripped but
  when??
- ECS version: 
  * make mirror/flip sprites eligible for HW sprites (else colors look wrong, specially player 2)
  * nice to have:
    => skeet shooting replace one blue from sky by unused color on that stage
	   and set different palette
	=> same for free style with water tile
- free style record doesn't work (stays at 0)
- OCS/ECS: cyan sprite color => blueish else water color is not good
- ECS version floppy not working on 68000 1MB chip
