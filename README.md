remake of Hyper Sports / Hyper Olympic'84 for amiga AGA & ECS

credits:
- jotd: transcode and amiga port, graphics & sound conversion
- no9: music (not yet!)
- PascalDe73: amiga icon
- Konami: original game

features:

- runs in PAL or NTSC, NTSC being possibly more reactive to button readings
(no effect when playing from keyboard)
- TODO: fixed record times at zero on free style (swimming) in the original. On the original game
  you have to use DSW to reset records and get valid times (but they're super hard
  to beat... At least with this version you get your own times, even if they suck).
- TODO: AGA and ECS versions available (ATM only AGA)

controls (joypad 1P/2P):

run: left/right or blue/green
action: red/fire

2P joypad controls only enabled if real joypad is connected in port 0

There's a fire1/fire2/up option too, which works well on joypads too, and also
allows to build your own custom controllers that don't use CD32 circuitry.
If this option (whdload only) is set:

- fire 1/fire 2: run
- up: jump
- up: insert coin
- left/right: start game 1P/2P

controls (keyboard):

1P run: left/right keys
1P action: ctrl
2P run: 4/6 num keys
2P action: 0 num key

5/6: insert coins
1-2: start 1-2 player game

cheat keys:

- F2: set 25 loops
